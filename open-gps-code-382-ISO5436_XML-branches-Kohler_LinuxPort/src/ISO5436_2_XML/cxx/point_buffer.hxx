    * blocks. One for each axis that stores all its data point values in a single array.
    * The three point buffer instances managing typesafe access to their memory blocks

    * OpenGPS::VectorBuffer::GetPointVectorProxy and providing a OpenGPS::PointVectorProxyContext
    * object which holds the array index of the row which - expanded over the three internal
    * memory blocks - constraints OpenGPS::VectorBuffer to be seen as one single OpenGPS::PointVector.
